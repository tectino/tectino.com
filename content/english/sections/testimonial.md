    content: "The experience I had with Tino was very valuable, he always gets to the point and explains everything in detail. In terms of professionalism it could hardly be better. He always takes his time and even after my course, Tino was open to any questions and answered them in detail. You can tell that he puts his heart and soul into his work.  I can only recommend anyone who wants to do a good training course to do it with him. The best thing is that the fun is not neglected either :) Keep up the good work!"
